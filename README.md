#  Virtual Teaching Assistant for Databases

This is a prototype of a GPT-3 based virtual teaching assistant (VTA) for database courses. A live demo can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/itrummer/vta/main/src/front/page.py).

The VTA uses GPT-3 to answer questions about database content. It generates answers using transcripts of the introductory database course by Immanuel Trummer (slides and videos [here](http://www.databaselecture.com)). Beyond a short answer in natural language, the VTA links to video snippets that relate to the question. These video snippets can be used to verify whether the generated answer is accurate.

The repository contains code for the VTA frontend (the code for the VTA backend is private at this point).
